       <h3> It’s been more than twenty years since kargil war,<br>
         but the unparalleled courage and sacrifice of Kargil heroes are still etched in the collective memory of the country.<br>
         Among these many bravehearts was a man who would become the face of every young Indian soldier who died fearlessly.<br>
        This is the tribute to Param Vir Chakra awardee Vikram Batra, the  courageous soldier whose actions in the battlefield transcended heroism.<br>
        Captain Vikram Batra sacrificed his life fighting Pakistani forces during the Kargil War in 1999, at the age of 24.<br>
         He was given the highest wartime gallantry award Param Vir Chakra posthumously.<br>
          Captain Batra became the face of the Indian soldier at Kargil, whose words reverberate even today - <p id="para">'Yeh Dil Maange More..'</p> <br>
          The soldier took the advertising slogan and elevated it to a motto for life.<br>
          Kargil was a long drawn out battle, a tenacious combat that was a fight to the finish.<br>
           As the whole nation waited with bated breath, the Indian flag firmly fluttered over Tiger Hills on the morning of July 4, 1999 and all of India celebrated.<br>
            Operation Vijay was successful.<br><br>
